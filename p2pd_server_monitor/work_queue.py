"""
There's some neat computer science here.

If deque was used it would have:
    Log(n) deletes.
    Log(1) popleft.
    Log(1) pop.

which is decent, but the Log(n) isn't ideal and can still be improved.
If you use a doubly-linked list over a deque and have a hashtable
of Node pointers in the list mapped by name / ID, you can then
have Log(1) deletes, too. So moving items between queues is all Log(1).

Would not work if the linked-list was indexed by positional offsets
over memory addresses as you would have to update each offset for a
delete. This is a very neat trick used by high performance schedulers.
